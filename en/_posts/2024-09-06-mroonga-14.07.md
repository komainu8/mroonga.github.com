    * MySQL Community Server 8.0.39
    * MySQl Community Server 8.4.2
    * Percona Server 8.0.37-29

  * [Ubuntu 24.04(noble)](/docs/install/ubuntu.html)

    * MariaDB 10.11.8
    * MySQL 8.0.39

  * [Ubuntu 22.04(jammy)](/docs/install/ubuntu.html)

    * MariaDB 10.6.18
    * MySQL 8.0.39
    * MySQL Community Server 8.0.39
    * MySQl Community Server 8.4.2

  * [Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)](/docs/install/debian.html)

    * MariaDB 10.11.8
    * MySQL Community Server 8.0.39
    * MySQl Community Server 8.4.2

* Disable descending index support

  If we don't add support for descending index with MariaDB >= 10.8, Mroonga returns wrong result with descending index.
  So, we disable descending index support now. However, we may re-try it later.

  By the way, if we use descending index with MySQL >= 8.0, MySQL returns error.

### Fixes

* Fix a crash bug with concurrent `FLUSH TABLES` and `INSERT`.

### Conclusion

Let's search by Mroonga!
