### Improvements

* [[CentOS](install/centos.md)][[AlmaLinux](install/almalinux.md)][[Debian GNU/Linux](install/debian.md)][[Ubuntu](install/ubuntu.md)] Added support for MySQL 5.7.41

* Added support for updating normal columns with composite primary key table. [GitHub#592][Reported by handmound]

We could not update normal columns when we set composite primary keys using Mroonga storage engine as below.

```sql
CREATE TABLE scores (
  name char(30) NOT NULL,
  score int NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (name, score),
  note char(30),
  FULLTEXT INDEX search_note_idx (note)
) ENGINE = Mroonga DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;

INSERT INTO scores (name, score) VALUES ("Taro Yamada", 29);

UPDATE scores SET note = "Note"
  WHERE name = "Taro Yamada" AND score = 29;

ERROR 1265 (01000): data truncated for primary key column: <name>
```

This error doesnâ€™t occur Mroonga with MariaDB.
