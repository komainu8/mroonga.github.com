## Mroonga 12.09 has been released!

Mroonga is a MySQL storage engine that supports fast fulltext search
and geolocation search. It is CJK ready. It uses Groonga as a storage
and fulltext search engine.

[Mroonga 12.09](/docs/news.html#release-12-09) has been released!

* How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)
* How to upgrade: [Upgrade guide](/docs/upgrade.html)

### Changes

The main changes are as follows.

### Improvements

* [CentOS](/docs/install/centos.html), [AlmaLinux](/docs/install/almalinux.html) Added support for MariaDB 10.9.

* [Ubuntu](/docs/install/ubuntu.html) Added support for MariaDB 10.6 on Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish).

* Added support for execution timeout parameter.

  In this version, Mroonga can abort queries in the specified time and the execution timeout parameter(``MAX_EXECUTION_TIME`` in MySQL and ``max_statement_time`` in MariaDB.) works correctly.

### Fixes

* Fixed a bug that Mroonga for Windows does not bundle groonga-normalizer-mysql.

  This bug had existed since Mroonga 12.02.
  Therefore, We can't groonga-normalizer-mysql from Mroonga 12.02 for Windows to Mroonga 12.08 for Windows.

### Conclusion

Please refer to [release note](/docs/news.html#release-12-09) about the detail of changes in this release.
