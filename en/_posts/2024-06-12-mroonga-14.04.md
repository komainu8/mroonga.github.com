* Added functionality to output an error when Mroonga's UDF is used while Mroonga is uninitialized. [MDEV-21166][Reported by Ian Gilfillan.]

  Before this fix, using Mroonga's UDF without initializing Mroonga (not having run `INSTALL PLUGIN mroonga`) would cause a crash.
  This patch changes the output from a crash to logging an error.

### Fixes

* [Wrapper mode](/docs/tutorial/wrapper.html) Fixed memory leaks in cases where engines not supporting online DDL are wrapped.

  In general, DDL operations like `ALTER TABLE` block access to the target table while in progress to maintain exclusive control.
  However, some storage engines allow operations on the target table during these operations (they can also be executed exclusively).
  The capability to operate on a table during such DDL operations is referred to as online DDL.

  The issue addressed occurs when wrapping storage engines that do not support online DDL in Mroonga's wrapper mode.
  It does not occur in storage mode or when using a combination of wrapper mode + InnoDB.

* [Storage mode](/docs/tutorial/storage.html) Fixed a bug causing crashes when inserting into tables with compressed `VARCHAR` or `TEXT` columns. [MDEV-31966][Reported by Elena Stepanova.]

  This issue occurs only in storage mode and not in wrapper mode.
