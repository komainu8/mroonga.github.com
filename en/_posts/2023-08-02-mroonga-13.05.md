### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

### Improvements

* [CentOS](/docs/install/centos.html), [AlmaLinux](/docs/install/almalinux.html) Added support MySQL 5.7.43.

* [CentOS](/docs/install/centos.html), [AlmaLinux](/docs/install/almalinux.html) Added support MySQL 8.0.34.

* [CentOS](/docs/install/centos.html), [AlmaLinux](/docs/install/almalinux.html) Added support for Percona Server 5.7.42-46.

* [CentOS](/docs/install/centos.html), [AlmaLinux](/docs/install/almalinux.html) Added support for Percona Server 8.0.33-25.

* [CentOS](/docs/install/centos.html), [AlmaLinux](/docs/install/almalinux.html) Added support MariaDB 10.4.30, 10.5.21, 10.6.14, 10.8.8, 10.9.7, 10.10.5, and 10.11.4.

* [CentOS](/docs/install/debian.html) Added support for MariaDB 10.5.19.

* [CentOS](/docs/install/debian.html) Added newly support for Debian 12 (bookworm).

  However, we only support Mroonga with MariaDB 10.11 in this release.

  Because the source of MySQL Community Server for Debian 12 doesn't exist in MySQL APT Repository(https://repo.mysql.com/apt/debian/dists/) currently.

  Therefore, we don't support Mroonga with MySQL community server 8.0 on Debian 12 temporarily.
  We will support Mroonga with MySQL community server 8.0 after the source of it for Debian 12 is available.

* Dropped support for MariaDB 10.3.

  It reached EOL on 2023-05-25.

Please refer to [release note](/docs/news.html#release-13-05) about the detail of changes in this release.
