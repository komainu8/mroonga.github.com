### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

### Improvements

* [CentOS](/docs/install/centos.html), [AlmaLinux](/docs/install/almalinux.html) Added newly support for MariaDB 10.11.

* [Amazon Linux 2](/docs/install/amazon-linux.html) Added support for MariaDB 10.5.18-1.amzn2.

* [CentOS](/docs/install/centos.html), [AlmaLinux](/docs/install/almalinux.html) Added support for Percona Server 8.0.32-24.

* [CentOS](/docs/install/centos.html), [AlmaLinux](/docs/install/almalinux.html) Added support for Percona Server 5.7.41-44.

* [Oracle Linux] Dropped support for Oracle Linux 8 and 9

  We supported Oracle Linux for installing Mroonga to MySQL official Docker image. However, a package that needed to install to MySQL official Docker image is Mroonga for MySQL community server minimal

  Therefore, we cann't install Mroonga to MySQL official Docker image even if we use Mroonga for Oracle Linux.

* [Ubuntu](/docs/install/ubuntu.html) Dropped support for Ubuntu 18.04.

  Because Ubuntu 18.04 reached EOL.

* [AlmaLinux](/docs/install/almalinux.html) Added support for MySQL community server minimal 8.0.

  This is for supporting the mysql:8.0-oracle Docker image.

### Conclusion

Please refer to [release note](/docs/news.html#release-13-01) about the detail of changes in this release.
