## Mroonga 14.08 has been released!

Mroonga is a MySQL storage engine that supports fast fulltext search
and geolocation search. It is CJK ready. It uses Groonga as a storage
and fulltext search engine.

Mroonga 14.08 has been released!

This is long time no release!

* How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)
* How to upgrade: [Upgrade guide](/docs/upgrade.html)

### Changes

Here are important changes in this release:

### Improvements

* We use CMake for building instead of the GNU Autotools.

  Using `configure` is deprecated. We recommend using `cmake` to build from source.

  Please refer [Others](/docs/install/others.html) about how to build from source with `cmake`.

### Fixes

* Fixed a bug that `SELECT` returned wrong result when we used multiple primary keys and primary keys included `VARBINARY` or `BLOB` type column.

  This bug only occurred in Mroonga 14.07.

  This bug doesn’t break an index. So, we don’t need to execute `REINDEX` command after this fix.

  If this bug occurred, the following query retrieved nothing.

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE logs (
    id INT,
    content VARBINARY(256),
    PRIMARY KEY (id, content)
  ) ENGINE=Mroonga DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;

  INSERT INTO logs(id, content) VALUES (1, 'aaa');
  INSERT INTO logs(id, content) VALUES (2, 'bbb');

  SELECT * FROM logs WHERE content = 'aaa';
  ```

### Conclusion

Let's search by Mroonga!
